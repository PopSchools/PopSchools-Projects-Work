## Where we are today

Three people have agreed to take an assignment to create landing pages for PopSchools projects. Originally, I wanted to offer a quick job to one person who would create the landing page for mutualaid.fund. I messed up on taking the first person so I decided to have the first three who responded take an assignment each. Everyone has been waiting on me (Nikema) to provide a description of the work and guidelines.
